This thesis examines the question as to whether there exists a significant statistical
relationship between online-generated social data from Twitter and Google Search
and daily directional movement of assets from different asset classes. Fitting different
linear models, I find that for some assets there exists such a relationship. Additionally,
I go further and assess the possibility of reliably forecasting social data using an
ARIMA algorithm and thus making inferences about daily directional movements.
The analyses unveil that this is possible to a certain degree.
